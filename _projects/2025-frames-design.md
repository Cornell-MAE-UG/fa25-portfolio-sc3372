For a class, we were asked to design a design a frame/mechanism to lift the maximum possible weight to the highest possible height. We were given the following: a 2D design space of 150cm long and 50cm tall, a rigid bar of a fixed length, 3 pin supports of which two need to be mounted on the ground and a linear actuator from a catalog. 

For my design, I chose to place my first pin to the left of the space, holding onto the rigid bar. I, then, placed my actuator, the RSX actuator, with my second pin, at various distances across the bar and at varying angles. 

In drawing all 3 possibilities, I displayed the different heights the rigid bar was able to be raised to based on the angulation and distance from the mounted pin of the rigid bar. 
- The red actuator is mounted closer to the pinned end of the bar, at an angle, which allows a larger mechanical advantage (more weight to be lifted), however it comes at the cost of less height obtained
- The blue actuator is mounted a little more out than the red actuator, providing a better balance between maximum height and larger weight, however, I believe if I drew the actuator more closer to the middle of the bar where the center of mass lies, the balance between the heigh and weight would be more optimized.
- The purple actuator is mounted furthest from the pivot, at a steep diagonal, providing a great lifting distance but sacrifies weight due to the small level arm, and thus torque.  

Overall, the process for the design allowed me to understand the need for different designs based on priorities.
