My name is Sophie Chen, and I am currently a sophomore studying Biomedical Engineering, intending to concentrate in Biomaterials and Drug Delivery. Currently, I am an undergraduate research in the Jiang Lab, where I support projects in vaccine development, delivery specificity and CAR-T therapies. I hope to further extend my knowledge and experience gained in the lab setting to my future endeavors in either the industry or continued academia. Additionally, I am interest in gaining experience in R&D roles at pharmaceutical companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and Merck.
